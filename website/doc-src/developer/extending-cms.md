# Extending Sutra CMS

While you can create entire sites without any custom server-side coding,
it is common to extend the functionality of Sutra CMS by customizing
code for a particular website or installation, interact with external
business workflows, grab data via REST services, and even integrate with
entire applications.

*Some ideas: weâ€™ve used this approach to hook websites into inventory
and financial systems, track shipping via web services, create client
portals, using the CMS as a reports server, etc.*

Creating your own modules keeps the core CMS functionality intact and
maintainable (and upgradable) without changing your custom code (and
vice versa). A common example is to create a module for each website in
the CMS to put custom blocks and functionality in.

## Core CMS modules

Sutra CMS is comprised of a number of modules:

1.  `_dsa_mosaic_WEB_cms`: core app screens and functionality
2.  `_dsa_mosaic_WEB_cms_blocks`: default blocks
3.  `_dsa_mosaic_WEB_cms_resources`: shared resources (code,
    relationships, value lists, images, etc)
4.  `_dsa_mosaic_WEB_cms_connector`: hook module to extend Sutra CMS
    functionality with other modules


## Wiring in your module

To hook everything together:

1.  create a Servoy module and specify type as `module`
2.  include the cms resources module in your new module (this gives you
    all of the Sutra CMS api code and resources to work with)
3.  include your new module in the Sutra CMS connector module (this
    attaches your module to the CMS)
